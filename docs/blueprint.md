## Core Features:

- Store Data Fetching: Fetch store data using the Etsy API, including listing counts, follower counts, and creation date.
- Listing Data Fetching: Fetch active listings for a given shop, including details like favorites, views, and tags.
- Listing Filtering: Filter listings based on user-defined criteria such as minimum favorites, maximum age, and minimum views.
- Data Presentation: Display the fetched and filtered data in a tabular format with color-coded highlights for listings meeting the specified criteria.
- Age Calculation: Calculate the age of a shop or listing based on its creation timestamp and flag if it's a new store
- Listing Summary: Use a generative AI tool to provide a brief summary of listings, so the user doesn't have to inspect all listings manually

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #6A5ACD (SlateBlue) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: #F0F8FF (AliceBlue), a light, desaturated tint of SlateBlue, for a clean and unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: #DDA0DD (Plum) to highlight important interactive elements such as buttons, and to draw attention to listings that meet the filtering criteria.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for both headlines and body text to provide a clean, readable interface. Its neutral appearance keeps focus on the Etsy product data itself.
- Use simple, monochrome icons to represent data categories (e.g., favorites, views). Use icons sparingly to maintain a clean, data-focused interface.
- The layout should be centered around a tabular display of product data. Use clear section headings and consistent spacing to improve readability.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., fade-in effects) when loading new data to provide feedback without distracting the user.
